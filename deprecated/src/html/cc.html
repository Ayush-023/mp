        <h1>About The Creative Commons Licenses</h1>
        <p>Add an explanation about CC and how the licenses work here. Example text from the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">Creative Commons' website</a>.</p>
        <p>The Creative Commons copyright licenses and tools forge a balance inside the traditional “all rights reserved” setting that copyright law creates. CC tools give everyone from individual creators to large companies and institutions a simple, standardized way to grant copyright permissions to their creative work. The combination of CC tools and CC users is a vast and growing digital commons, a pool of content that can be copied, distributed, edited, remixed, and built upon, all within the boundaries of copyright law.
</p>
        <p> 
<strong>Creative Commons Zero (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a>)</strong>: This tool allows you to waive all your copyrights and related rights in a work, effectively placing the work into the public domain. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">Learn more</a>. </p>
<p></p><strong>Creative Commons Attribution (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a></strong>): This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials.
        </p>
<p><strong>Creative Commons-ShareAlike (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA</a></strong>): This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to “copyleft” free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. This is the license used by Wikipedia, and is recommended for materials that would benefit from incorporating content from Wikipedia and similarly licensed projects.
</p>
<p><strong>Creative Commons-NoDerivs (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC BY-ND</a></strong>): This license allows for redistribution, commercial and non-commercial, as long as it is passed along unchanged and in whole, with credit to you.</p>
<p><strong>Creative Commons-NonCommercial (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC BY-NC</a></strong>): This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms.
</p>
<p><strong>Creative Commons-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a></strong>): This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms.
</p>
<p><strong>Creative Commons-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a></strong>): This license is the most restrictive of our six main licenses, only allowing others to download your works and share them with others as long as they credit you, but they can’t change them in any way or use them commercially.
