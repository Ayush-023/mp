> The [Platform Toolkit][mp-prod] is a material to guide content sharing
> platforms when adding the option of CC licensing.  These aren't hard-set
> requirements, but suggestions on how to make the implementation smooth for
> users and platform alike. The process towards building it was described in a
> series of [blog posts][revamp] on the CC Open Source blog.

### Getting started

The toolkit is placed in the `docs/` folder along with a frozen copy of the
[Vocabulary][vocabulary] stylesheets. By opening the
[`docs/index.html`](docs/index.html) file, you should be able to visualize the
platform toolkit page. The same index and associated files are served, as is,
in the production and staging environments.

Everything pertaining to the previous toolkit and model platform material is
placed in the `deprecated/` folder.
