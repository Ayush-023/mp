> The [Platform Toolkit](creativecommons.org/platform/toolkit/) is a material to guide content sharing platforms when adding the option of CC licensing. These aren't hard-set requirements, but suggestions on how to make the implementation smooth for users and platform alike. The process towards building it was described in a series of [blog posts](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/blog/entries/cc-platform-toolkit-revamp/) on the CC Open Source blog.


### Getting started

The new toolkit is placed in the `platform-toolkit` folder along with a frozen copy of the Vocabulary stylesheets ( here's more information about [Vocabulary](https://github.com/creativecommons/vocabulary)). By opening the `index.html` file in this folder you should be able to visualize the platform toolkit page. Everything pertaining to the previous toolkit and model platform material is placed in the `deprecated` folder.
